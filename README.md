Assignment 1: Create a program that functions similarly to the UNIX command cat.

Assignment 2: Create a program that reads throught the entries of a directory and prints out information similar to the find command with the -ls flag.

Assignment 3: Create a program that functions as a simplistic UNIX shell.  The program should be capable of launching one program at a time, with arguments, and should report the exit status, as well as resource usage statistics.

Assignment 4: Create a program that writes the contents of a file into a pipeline of grep piped into more.  If the user causes a SIGINT, write the total number of files and bytes processed to stderr and then exit the program.
